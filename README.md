PROJECT : 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction using Machine Learning

✅ Level 2- Task 2


This project focuses on predicting the quality of red wine based on physicochemical attributes using multiple classification models. The goal is to analyze key chemical properties and apply machine learning 

classifiers to predict wine quality effectively.


📂 Dataset Used

WineQT.csv: Contains chemical properties of red wines and corresponding quality scores (ranging from 3 to 8).

📌 Key Concepts Covered

Classifier Models: Random Forest, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

Chemical Analysis: Focus on density, acidity, alcohol, sulphates, etc.

Data Handling: Pandas and NumPy for cleaning and manipulation

Visualization: Correlation heatmaps, boxplots, and confusion matrices using Seaborn and Matplotlib
